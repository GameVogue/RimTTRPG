Journalist's Ship
---
#scenario

#### Adventure Hook
A stranded Persona AI operating a crashed Glitterworld journalist ship reaches out to the party via an encrypted line on regional comms. The ship is 60 miles away, is hidden in a rocky canyon, and is remaining in low power mode to stay hidden. Recognizing the party as off-worlders, the Persona offers the party transport back to their homeworld if they can defend the ship for long enough to complete the 3 hour drive core warmup cycle. The issue is, the ship landed near an [[Outlanders]] town called Malston which has since been taken over by scavenging [[Pirates]], who will surely detect the power surge and come to dismantle the ship or steal it for their own sinister ends.

##### The Ship
This Glitterworld ship is a top of the line small craft meant to house and sustain three crew members and supports a wide array of communications, imaging, and data storage devices used for journalism and reporting. Structurally, the ship is in good condition, aside from all nonessential components being powered off. There is enough fuel left for several jumps. The ship's log has information about the previous crew, and the Persona AI is willing to share information as well. The Persona AI is designed to manage all aspects of flying the vessel and supporting the crew.

##### The Crew
The crew of this vessel were a team of documentary journalists fresh out of school, hoping to find a story in the struggles of day to day life as an Outlander on the Rim. Unfortunately, the news that a crew of fancy Glitterworld post-grads had landed at Malston drew the unwanted attention of a local pirate gang, who arrived days later and ransacked the town. The fate of the journalists is unknown, although the Persona AI knows they were not well armed and had no experience surviving outside of the comforts of a Glitterworld, beyond what was taught to them at university.

##### The Pirates
These pirates are scavengers and looters primarily, and wouldn't normally risk a full on assault of a town, but the temptation of Glitterworld loot was too strong. They are equipped with Steamworld gear, including revolvers, bolt-action rifles, and basic cutting tools for salvage. Their clothing is tattered Steamworld garb such as top hats, bowlers, vests, corsets, and old mechanical watches.

Escape with Persona AI Ship

#### Adventure Hook
A stranded Persona AI operating a crashed Glitterworld journalist ship reaches out to the party via an encrypted line on regional comms. The ship is 60 miles away, is hidden in a rocky canyon, and is remaining in low power mode to stay hidden. Recognizing the party as off-worlders, the Persona offers the party transport back to their homeworld if they can defend the ship for long enough to complete the 3 hour drive core warmup cycle. The issue is, the ship landed near a Outlander town which has since been taken over by scavenging pirates, who will surely detect the power surge and come to dismantle the ship or steal it for their own sinister ends.

##### The Ship
This Glitterworld ship is a top of the line small craft meant to house and sustain three crewmembers and supports a wide array of communications, imaging, and data storage devices used for journalism and reporting. Structurally, the ship is in good condition, aside from all nonessential components being powered off. There is enough fuel left for several jumps. The ship's log has information about the previous crew, and the Persona AI is willing to share information as well. The Persona AI is designed to manage all aspects of flying the vessel and supporting the crew.

##### The Crew
The crew of this vessel were a team of documentary journalists fresh out of school, hoping to find a story in the struggles of day to day life as an Outlander

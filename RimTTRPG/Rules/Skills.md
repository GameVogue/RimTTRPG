Skills
---
Skills are a numeric value from 0 - 20 which represent how skilled a player is at certain types of tasks. All players will have at least 1 point in each skill, unless their backstory precludes them from certain skills.

##### Increasing Skills
Skills can be increased to a maximum of 20, including equipment or other modifiers. Backstories award skill points in certain skills, and the player can also choose traits during character creation that award skill increases. Additionally, certain items found in the world may permanently or temporarily increase certain skills. Finally, each time a player rolls the maximum roll using a skill (two natural sixes on a 2d6) the skill is increased by one point. After reaching level 11 in a given skill, players can also lose a point in that skill every time they roll the minimum using it (two natural ones on a 2d6). Players cannot decrease a skill below 10 in this way, however. This mechanic is also affected by Passion. During character creation, certain backstories and traits may apply a Passion to one or more skills, which causes the maximum roll bonus to increase a skill by two points rather than one.

##### Skill Modifiers
All rolls must utilize a specific skill. Rolls with that skill apply the following modifiers based on the skill level.

| Level | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | -inf |
| 1-4 | -3 |
| 5-9 | 0 |
| 10-14 | +2 |
| 15-19 | +4 |
| 20 | +5 |

#### Skill List
Some skills may seem more or less useful than others, depending on the type of campaign being played. Consult your GM to determine what skills will be essential.

**Animals**
The _animals_ skill determines how well a character handles wild and domesticated animals, and increases the chance to go undetected while _hunting_ wild animals.

**Artistic**
The _artistic_ skill is the proficiency to create beautiful works of art, and appraise the value of art. It also allows the character to add artistic embellishments to structures and items created by others, increasing their value or perceived status. Additionally, artists may be adept at duplicating physical items like signatures, maps, signet rings, badges, and other small and dexterous creation tasks not covered by Construction or Crafting.

**Construction**
The _construction_ skill governs a wide variety of building and engineering tasks, centered around creating structures, as well as deconstructing structures back into useful resources. Structures includes not only walls, roofs, and furniture but also plumbing, electrical grids, defensive emplacements and barriers, and even starships and nuclear power generators, assuming there are blueprints and materials available.

**Cooking**
The _cooking_ skill affects the quality and type of food that can be prepared, how quickly it can be prepared, as well as how efficiently animals can be butchered for meat and other resources. Higher skill increases yield and decreases waste. Higher quality food is worth more, satisfies hunger for longer, and reduces the chance of food poisoning.

**Crafting**
The _crafting_ skill determines the quality and type of items a character can create, given the appropriate tools and materials. This ranges from smithing, tailoring, reloading ammunition cartridges, and assembling basic items all the way up to manufacturing complex objects like power armor using specialized facilities. Crafting skill also determines the ability to disassemble such items back into useful materials, where possible.

**Medical**
The _Medical_ skill level is the main factor for medical treatment quality and surgery success chance. Low quality treatment will increase the chance of infection, and the likelihood of permanent health conditions. Medical surgery, if not successful, can fail in minor or major ways, even causing the death of the patient. Higher grade medicine and medical equipment as well as a sterile environment significantly boost the effectiveness of all medical treatments, independent of the skill level of the doctor.

**Melee**
The _melee_ skill increases a character's chance to hit a target with a melee weapon, and also increases their chance to dodge an incoming melee attack. When rolling to hit a melee attack, add your melee skill modifier to the roll. When being attacked by a melee attack, add your melee skill modifier to your CTH threshold.

**Mining**
The _mining_ skill allows characters to dig tunnels, trenches, pits, into the sides of mountains, and breach through walls, given they have the appropriate tool. This can allow characters to create safe places or access certain areas in an unconventional way. Characters can also use this skill to mine valuable minerals or other resources necessary for crafting, if they are present. Higher skill in mining increases the speed as well as decreasing the likelihood of cave-ins.

**Intellectual**
This _intellectual_ skill determines generalized knowledge and memory, ability to solve puzzles and complete research, and interface with computers and other complex electronics, as well as better understand the motivations and underlying programming of artificial intelligence.

**Plants**
The _plants_ skill determines knowledge of plants, foraging, and agriculture. Some plants have a minimum skill requirement to recognize and utilize, notably Healroot which can be used to make medicine for treating wounds. This skill also allows characters to cultivate and harvest crops, and forage for edible wild plants.

**Shooting**
The _shooting_ skill affects a character's accuracy with a ranged weapon. When rolling to hit a ranged attack, add your shooting skill modifier to the roll.

**Social**
The _social_ skill modifier can be added to any attempt to persuade, lie, or otherwise socially influence a character, including bartering for better prices in trade or attempting to negotiate a truce with an enemy.

Character Creation

[[Character Sheet]]

During character creation, all choices may be altered until the character is finalized, when play can begin. The following order is merely a suggestion.

1. Choose a backstory from the [[Backstories ]] section. This will influence the rest of the character creation process. Alternatively, create your own backstory and ask your GM to assign skill bonuses from it.
2. Choose a name and character appearance based on your backstory. Embellish your backstory where desired and create links to other players' characters when possible.
3. Choose up to two traits from the [[Traits]] section.
4. All [[Skills]] start at 5 unless added to, subtracted from, or zeroed by a Backstory or Trait. Apply these skill points.
5. Roll 2d6 skill points or take 7 skill points and distribute them among your skills. No skill can surpass 20.
6. Roll 3d6 and multiply the highest die roll by 10 to get your HP.
7. Spend 1d6x100 Silver on starting gear, at a tech level determined by your GM, and keep the remaining silver.

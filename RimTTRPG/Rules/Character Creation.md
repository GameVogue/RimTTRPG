Character Creation
---

During character creation, all choices may be altered until the character is finalized, when play can begin. The following order is merely a suggestion.

1. Choose a backstory from the [[Backstories ]] section. This will influence the rest of the character creation process. Alternatively, create your own backstory and ask your GM to assign skill bonuses from it.
2. Choose a name and character appearance based on your backstory. Embellish your backstory where desired and create links to other players' characters when possible.
3. Choose up to two traits from the [[Traits]] section.
4. All skills start at 5 unless added to, subtracted from, or zeroed by a Backstory or Trait. Apply these skill points.
5. Roll 2d6 skill points or take 7 skill points and distribute them among your skills. No skill can surpass 20.
6. Spend 1d6x100 Silver on starting gear, at a tech level determined by your GM.
7. Play!

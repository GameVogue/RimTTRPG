Backstory

Backstories inspire the origin of your character as well as add bonuses and passions to certain skills.


##### Imperial

**House Servant**
You were a low-level servant in a royal house. You leaned rooms and moved items as directed by the senior staff, while attempting to remain invisible to the lords and ladies of the house.
*Cooking +3, Construction +3, Mining +4*

**Head Butler**
You were the head servant in a royal house. You managed the other servants to ensure the lord's will was done, even before the lord knew what it was.
*Social +4, Cooking +3, Crafting +2*

**Royal Cook**
You made meals for your aristocratic patrons. Only the finest food was acceptable, so you tended a small garden on the mansion grounds to get the freshest herbs and vegetables. You fell in love with the food itself.
*Cooking +7 (B), Plants +2*

**Imperial Priest**
You were a priest in the imperial church. You spent half your time studying books to understand the relationship between God's aspects and the facets of your society. The other half was spent preaching the evils of sloth and drink.
*Social +5, Intellectual +5*

**Corporate Fixer**
You were a fixer for an energy corporation. Your work required knowing when to push, when to pull, when to back down and when to strike. The job fit your natural lack of empathy. While violence was unusual, you stayed prepared for anything.
*Social +4, Shooting +3, Melee +3*

**Line Infanteer**
You were an ordinary infanteer in an imperial battalion. Conscripted at a young age to add bodies the army, you learned the methods of fighting well enough to satisfy your officers. However, you never quite understood what was going on around you enough to really believe in it.
*Shooting +4, Melee +3*


##### Glitterworld

**Charity Worker**
Glitterworlds are havens of safety and comfort for those lucky enough to live there, but you could not ignore nearby planets where people suffered in poverty. You spent your working life appealing for donations and supporting those in need.
*Social +8 (B), 0 Shooting, 0 Melee*

**Architect**
You designed and constructed buildings. On your glitterworld home, most of the technical aspects of architecture were handled by an AI. This enabled you to push the artistic limits of the craft, but also meant you never had to get your hands dirty at building sites.
*Construction +5 (B), Artistic +7 (B), Crafting -3*

Combat
---

At the start of combat, combatants roll 2d6 for Initiative, adding the modifier from their speed stat.

Players have two actions on their turn. Any of the following actions can be taken:
- Attack: Use your currently equipped weapon to make an attack.
- Move: Move up to your full movement speed.
- Take Cover: Duck behind an object in the environment to decrease the enemy chance to hit.
- Stabilize: Apply emergency first aid using your medical supplies to stop bleeding.
- Use: Any quick action involving using an item or operating a device.

##### Chance To Hit
When a player takes the Attack action, they roll 2d6 plus either their Melee or Shooting modifier. This number must meet or exceed the Chance To Hit threshold (CTH) of the targeted enemy. CTH threshold is calculated using the size of the target, the amount of cover the target has, and the distance to the target compared to the range of the weapon.

| Size | CTH |
|---|---|
| Tiny | 8 |
| Small | 7 |
| Medium | 6 |
| Large | 5 |
| Gigantic | 4 |

| Cover | CTH |
|---|---|
| 1/4 | +1 |
| 1/2 | +3 |
| 3/4 | +5 |

Range linearly affects CTH. Targets inside the range of the weapon has no effect on CTH. Targets up to twice the range of the weapon have their CTH threshold multiplied by 2. Targets up to three times the range of the weapon have their CTH multiplied by 3, and etc.

Melee attacks are also affected by the target's melee skill modifier, which is added to the CTH.

##### Damage
Each weapon has a damage value and damage type that is directly applied when a hit is successful. Armor is rolled by the entity who was hit and the armor total is subtracted from the damage. The primary damage types are sharp and blunt. All sharp damage that is negated by armor is then halved and applied as blunt damage. All blunt damage that is negated by armor is reduced to zero. Other types of damage, such as Fire and Energy damage, are applied automatically on a hit if the armor does not list a resistance to it.

**Bloodied**
Once a character or creature has been reduced to below half their hitpoints, they suffer a temporary -5 penalty to all skill modifiers, including melee and shooting. Their movement speed is also reduced by half. This state is referred to as "bloodied". Once bloodied, you are bleeding, and will continue to lose one hitpoint per round of combat. Hitpoints can be replenished through medical care and rest, or the negative effects can be temporarily ignored via certain drugs and abilities.

**Downed**
Once characters or creatures reach zero hitpoints they begin bleeding out and must be stabilized within three rounds of combat before expiring. A character who has been revived from bleeding out will gain a random long-term health issue related to the injury that knocked them down. These issues often require surgery to heal.

Psycasting
---

Psycasts are psychic abilities that allow the user to influence reality in ways that seem impossible. Psycasters accomplish this by connecting to the psychic field, a mysterious force first discovered by [[The Empire]].

To use psycasts, a player must first have a Psylink level equal or greater than the level of the psycast. A player may have up to 6 levels of psylink. These levels can be gained either by acquiring a Psylink Neuroformer, or by meditating at an Anima tree. Only certain [[Backstories]] allow meditation at Anima trees.

Psycasting is limited by the amount of Psyfocus available to the user and their Neural Heat limit.

##### Psyfocus
Psyfocus is a pool of energy built through meditation. Each psycast requires a percentage of psyfocus to be expended. If there is not enough psyfocus available, the psycast cannot be used.

Certain structures and items grant increased psyfocus gain during meditation, such as shrines and sculptures. High level psycasters of The Empire meditate on special Meditation Thrones. Psyfocus gain can also be increased through the use of certain drugs.

##### Neural Heat
A psycaster's neural heat limit is the primary limitation to how many psycasts they can perform in a given period of time. Each psycast gives the caster a certain amount of neural heat. The psycaster's neural heat limit can be exceeded to use further psycasts, but with certain consequences.

Heat naturally decreases over time, with faster rates provided by additional levels of psylink. Certain items, such as Eltex items, can help dissipate neural heat more quickly.

##### Psycasts

**Burden**
*Slow the target for a short time by suppressing motor activity in the brain.*
One organic target up to 30 tiles away has their speed reduced by half for 20 seconds.

**Painblock**
*Block pain pathways in the target's brain for a short time. This can allow a person to move and act even with grievous injuries which would normally incapacitate them.*
Negates the effects of the Bloodied state on one organic target up to 25 tiles away for 100 seconds.

**Stun**
*Momentarily disrupt motor function in the target's brain, preventing any movement.*
Prevents one organic target up to 20 tiles away from taking any actions for 5 seconds.

**Chunk Skip**
*Skip 5 chunks of rock or slag and scatter them near the target point. This is useful for producing cover during offensive operations.*
Teleport up to five inanimate objects within a 25 tile radius towards a point you choose within the radius. These objects will not intersect with any other objects or entities, and must land in a configuration of 5 adjacent tiles.

**Solar Pinhole**
*Generate a microscopic skipgate linked to the core of a nearby star. Solar material leaks through the pinprick in spacetime, illuminating and warming the surrounding area with daylight until it closes.*
Creates daylight and heat in a 12 tile radius for 5 days. Can be cast up to 25 tiles away. The microscopic skipgate is too small t

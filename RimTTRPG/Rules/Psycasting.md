Psycasting
---

Psycasts are psychic abilities that allow the user to influence reality in ways that seem impossible. Psycasters accomplish this by connecting to the psychic field, a mysterious force first discovered by [[The Empire]].

To use psycasts, a player must first have a Psylink level equal or greater than the level of the psycast. A player may have up to 6 levels of psylink. These levels can be gained either by acquiring a Psylink Neuroformer, or by meditating at an Anima tree. Only certain [[Backstories]] allow meditation at Anima trees.

Psycasting is limited by the amount of Psyfocus available to the user and their Neural Heat limit.

##### Psyfocus
Psyfocus is a pool of energy built through meditation. Each psycast requires a certain amount of psyfocus to be expended. If there is not enough psyfocus available, the psycast cannot be used.

Certain structures and items grant increased psyfocus gain during meditation, such as shrines and sculptures. High level psycasters of The Empire meditate on special Meditation Thrones. Psyfocus gain can also be increased through the use of certain drugs.

##### Neural Heat
A psycaster's neural heat limit is the primary limitation to how many psycasts they can perform in a given period of time. Each psycast gives the caster a certain amount of neural heat. The psycaster's neural heat limit can be exceeded to use further psycasts, but with certain consequences.

Heat naturally decreases over time, with faster rates provided by additional levels of psylink. Certain items, such as Eltex items, can help dissipate neural heat more quickly.

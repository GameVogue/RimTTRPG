Psycasting
---

To use psycasts, a player must first have a Psylink level equal or greater than the level of the psycast. A player may have up to 6 levels of psylink. These levels can be gained either by acquiring a psylink neuroformer, or by meditating at an Anima tree. Only certain [[Backstories]] allow meditation at Anima trees.

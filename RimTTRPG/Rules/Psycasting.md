Psycasting
---

Psycasts are psychic abilities that allow the user to influence reality in ways that seem impossible. Psycasters accomplish this by connecting to the psychic field, a mysterious force first discovered by [[The Empire]].

To use psycasts, a player must first have a Psylink level equal or greater than the level of the psycast. A player may have up to 6 levels of psylink. These levels can be gained either by acquiring a Psylink Neuroformer, or by meditating at an Anima tree. Only certain [[Backstories]] allow meditation at Anima trees.

Psycasting is limited by the amount of Psyfocus available to the user and their Neural Heat limit.

##### Psyfocus
Psyfocus is a pool of energy built through meditation.

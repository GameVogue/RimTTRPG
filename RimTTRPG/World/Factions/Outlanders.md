Outlanders
---
The term "Outlanders" refers to industrial tech level factions most commonly found in outer rim worlds. They are generally concerned with the practical matters of trade, trust, and survival.

They often originate from the failed or abandoned colonial efforts of more advanced worlds, and generally operate independently of any overarching intergalactic authority. These frontier towns often have traders, craftsmen, town guards, and farmers. Some are governed by a town council, and some by a sheriff or boss.

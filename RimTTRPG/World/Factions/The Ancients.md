The Ancients

#factions #lore

Ancients is a general term for pre-Empire ancient spacer tech level societies which are now all but lost to history. Very occasionally, pockets of Ancients are discovered in ancient cryptosleep caskets, often accompanied by dormant Insectoids. Sometimes, the inhabitants of these caskets even remain alive when woken up, suffering from extreme cryptosleep sickness. What little information we have about Ancient society comes from these individuals, including the fact that the Ancients genetically engineered the Insectoids in order to fight the Mechanoid Hive threat which eventually wiped them out.

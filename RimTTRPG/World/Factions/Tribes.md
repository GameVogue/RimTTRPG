Tribes
---
Some outer rim worlds are host to neolithic tech level nomadic tribes, whose ancestors crashed here a thousand years ago, or survived some cataclysm that destroyed a technological civilization there. In any case, the tribal peoples mostly live off the land using primitive tools and weapons. Despite their apparent technological weakness, the they can be dangerous enemies and valuable friends because of their immense knowledge of the local environment and skills in foraging, herbal medicine, and hunting.

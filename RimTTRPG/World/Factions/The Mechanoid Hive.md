The Mechanoid Hive
---

Killer machines of unknown origin. Hidden in ancient structures, under mounds of dust, or at the bottom of the ocean, mechanoids can self-maintain for thousands of years. They seem to be unified in purpose, but not well-coordinated in action. While some historians believe they're autonomous weapons left over from an ancient war, tribal legends describe them as the demonic servants of a sleeping god.

Mechanoids roam the galaxy and attack all life seemingly at random, preferring to drop from orbit into a remote location and begin assembling factories, which create more mechanoids, and expanding exponentially if not quelled.

Insectoid ecosystems were genetically engineered by the Ancients to fight Mechanoid invasions and thus the two factions are always hostile to one another.

They come in five forms: Centipedes, Lancers, Pikemen and Termites.
- Centipedes are the Mechanoids' heavy units, equipped with a minigun, inferno cannon, or heavy charge blaster, as well as remarkably tough armor. Their primary purpose is to soak up damage from static defenses while suppressing enemy infantry's movements. They move very slowly, making hit-and-run or kiting attacks possible.
- Scythers are the Mechanoids' melee units. They attack with blades that are attached to their appendages. They are very deadly in hand-to-hand combat, and it's easy to lose limbs to a scyther. They are best engaged from a distance.
- Lancers are the Mechanoids' light ranged units, equipped with a charge lance. They fire in bursts for high damage at medium range, but are not heavily armored.
- Pikemen are the Mechanoids' snipers, equipped with a needle gun. They deal low damage per shot but have immense range and accuracy. They are virtually incapable of melee combat and can be easily dispatched at close range.
- Termites are the Mechanoid's breachers, equipped with a thump cannon. They do devastating damage to emplacements and structures, and their primary purpose is to breach defensive walls to allow access for Lancers and Scythers.

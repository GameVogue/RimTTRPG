Utility Items
---

A variety of specialized items characters may carry on their person.

**Shield Belt**
A projectile-repulsion device. It will attempt to stop incoming projectiles or shrapnel, but does nothing against melee attacks or heat. It prevents the wearer from firing out, and shuts down instantly if hit by EMP. Shield belts can block 50HP worth of ranged damage before needing to recharge, and recharge 5HP per round when not taking fire.

**Smokepop Pack**
A defensive smokescreen. When activated, it will release a cloud of smoke in a 30 foot radius, obscuring incoming shots and preventing autoturrets from locking on. Applies 3/4 cover to all characters obscured by the smokescreen. Stores three uses before needing to be reloaded with chemfuel.

**Jump Pack**
A single-person burst rocket for short-ranged flight. With its integrated harness and guidance assistant, the jump pack allows anyone to leap 20 feet forward at high speed, even over low obstacles. The fuel tank allows for five jumps before needing to be refueled with chemfuel.

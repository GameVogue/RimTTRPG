# How To Contribute
Hello! Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to the project.

To contribute, please submit a pull request ([a what?](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)) to the main branch with a summary of what you changed, and why.
RimTTRPG is written in MarkDown and uses MediaWiki style [wikilinks](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links). I am personally editing the project in Obsidian.md

If you do not feel comfortable using git, you can still suggest a change either by submitting a factual correction 
(such as a self-contradiction in the rules or incorrect math) to [Issues](https://github.com/GameVogue/RimTTRPG/issues) or by making a more general suggestion
(such as thoughts on reworking a mechanic) in [Discussions](https://github.com/GameVogue/RimTTRPG/discussions/).

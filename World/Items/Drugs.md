Drugs can be useful to gain temporary benefits of various sorts, but can lead to addiction, negative side effects, and even overdose resulting in permanent ailments or death. Every time a character consumes a drug, they must roll 2d6 and beat the addiction threshold.

| Drug | Effect Summary | Addiction | Market Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alcohol | Pain Reduction | 3 | 12 |
| Go-Juice | Pain Reduction, Speed | 3 | 50 |
| Psychite Tea | Rest Increase | 4 | 10 |
| Smokeleaf | Recovery Increase | 4 | 10 |
| Wake-up | Rest Increase | 6 | 35 |
| Luciferium | Increased Stats | 12 | 70 |

Addiction can be removed with a 30 day detox period, during which the negative effects of withdrawal are present.

#### Effects & Side-Effects

This includes beer, wine, cider, and a variety of hard liquor and cocktails. Most cultures have a long and colorful history with the substance, and include it in their cultural traditions.

Positive Effects: Each dose reduces the bloodied threshold by 5 hitpoints, +1 social skill modifier.

Negative Effects: Each dose reduces move speed by 1, and shooting skill modifier by 1.

Overdose: Overdosing induces vomiting, further reduces move speed by 1, and applies -2 to all modifiers.

Withdrawal: Applies a -2 to all modifiers.

**Go-Juice**
A synthetic combat drug developed for space marines during the early days of interplanetary warfare. Go-juice blocks pain and increases the user's combat abilities. It also enhances movement speed. Go-Juice is typically administered via injection.

Positive Effects: +2 to movement speed, -15 bloodied threshold, +2 to shooting and melee modifiers

Negative Effects: None

Overdose: Chemical brain damage, lasting 120 days, which applies -3 to all skill modifiers.

**Psychite Tea**
A fragrant tea infused with leaves of the psychoid plant. Drinking it induces a subtle psychite euphoria. Some cultures use psychite tea, both as a daily energizer and part of social and religious rituals. The tea can be made at a campfire or other heat source simply by infusing psychoid leaves in water.

Dosage: Psychite Tea cannot be overdosed, but its positive effects do not stack.

Positive Effects: Reduces the number of hours needed to be fully rested by 2, affecting the previous rest.

Negative Effects: None

Overdose: None

Withdrawal: Increases the number of hours needed to be fully rested by 2, induces mild irritability.

**Smokeleaf**
The leaf of the smokeleaf plant can be rolled tightly into a joint and smoked, encouraging a calm and meditative mental state and a mild increase in hunger. It also reduces pain and promotes healing.

Dosage: The effects can stack without fear of overdose, with but each additional dose is half as effective. The effects last 6 hours.

**Wake-Up**
An addictive stimulant. Fills the need for rest, and allows users to work for extended periods without getting tired. Addiction causes reduced mental performance and, sometimes, psychotic breaks with reality.

Dosage: Each dose after the first has a 50% chance of overdose within a 72 hour period. The effects stack, and last 24 hours.

**Luciferium**
A concoction of mechanites that dramatically improve the body's functioning in all respects. Over time, it can even heal old scarred-over wounds or brain damage, though it cannot regenerate lost limbs. Unfortunately, without the moderating effects of regular doses every five or six days, the mechanites lose cohesion, causing continuous berserk rages and, eventually, death. After the first dose, there is no way to get the mechanites out, ever. On the urbworlds, they call Luciferium the 'Devil's Bargain'.

Dosage: Effects are permanent after the first dose, but the drug must be taken every 6 days to prevent withdrawal.

Positive Effects: +1 movement speed, +5 to all skill modifiers, -10 bloodied threshold, one temporary or permanent negative physical ailment can be chosen to be healed every 30 days, excluding lost limbs.

Negative Effects: None, _yet._

Overdose: None

Withdrawal: Intense pain, 2/6 chance per day to go into a berserk rage and attack anyone near you, and death after 10 days.

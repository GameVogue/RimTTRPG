Pirates
---
A loose confederation of pirate gangs who've agreed to mostly fight outsiders instead of fighting each other.
Pirates don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors.
Their technology level depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. Mostly they carry gunpowder weapons, though some prefer to stab victims at close range.

Some pirate gangs have also taken to cannibalism, and others have become slave traders.
